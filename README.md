# SpotifyScripts
Control Spotify from the commandline

**IMPORTANT: DBus support in Spotify Beta 1.0 seems broken, so these scripts will not work with the latest Spotify versions.**
Please see https://github.com/olejon/spotcommander/wiki/DowngradeSpotify for instructions on how to downgrade. (Every Spotify version that works with SpotCommander should also work with spotictl.)
